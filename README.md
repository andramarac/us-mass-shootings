## About this dataset

This analysis is based on data on US Mass Shootings provided by Mother Jones and it covers an in-depth look at mass shootings cases from 1982 to 2020 (February).

How Mother Jones defines mass shootings:

"Our research focused on <b>indiscriminate rampages in public places resulting in four or more victims killed by the attacker</b>. We exclude shootings stemming from more conventionally motivated crimes such as armed robbery or gang violence. (Or in which the perpetrators have not been identified.)"<br>
